The server then returns a row of underscores (space separated)—one for each letter in the secret word—and asks the user to guess a letter. If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the word is redisplayed with all instances of that letter shown in the correct positions, along with any letters correctly guessed on previous turns. If the letter does not appear in the word, the user is charged with an incorrect guess. The user keeps guessing letters until either (1) the user has correctly guessed all the letters in the word\nor (2) the user has made six incorrect guesses.\n\nYou are required to write a \"guess\" function that takes current word (with underscores) as input and returns a guess letter. You will use the API codes below to play 1,000 Hangman games. You have the opportunity to practice before you want to start recording your game results.\n\nYour algorithm is permitted to use a training set of approximately 250,000 dictionary words. Your algorithm will be tested on an entirely disjoint set of 250,000 dictionary words. Please note that this means the words that you will ultimately be tested on do NOT appear in the dictionary that you are given. You are not permitted to use any dictionary other than the training dictionary we provided. This requirement will be strictly enforced by code review.\n\nYou are provided with a basic, working algorithm. This algorithm will match the provided masked string (e.g. a _ _ l e) to all possible words in the dictionary, tabulate the frequency of letters appearing in these possible words, and then guess the letter with the highest frequency of appearence that has not already been guessed. If there are no remaining words that match then it will default back to the character frequency distribution of the entire dictionary.\n\nThis benchmark strategy is successful approximately 18% of the time. Your task is to design an algorithm that significantly outperforms this benchmark.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler\nimport json\nimport requests\nimport random\nimport string\nimport secrets\nimport time\nimport re\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport time\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport math\nimport collections\nimport pickle\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch\nfrom torch import nn\nfrom torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\n#from torch.cuda.amp import autocast as autocast_old\nfrom torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast\n#from torch.amp import autocast\n\ntry:\n    from urllib.parse import parse_qs, urlencode, urlparse\nexcept ImportError:\n    from urlparse import parse_qs, urlparse\n    from urllib import urlencode\n\nfrom requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions import InsecureRequestWarning\n\nrequests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings(InsecureRequestWarning)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-06-01T04:29:18.008697Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-06-01T04:29:18.008953Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-06-01T04:29:22.295872Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-06-01T04:29:18.008913Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-06-01T04:29:22.295107Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"code","source":"CHAR_MAP = {'_': 27, '{': 28, '|': 29}\nfor i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase, start=1):\n    CHAR_MAP[c] = i\n\ndef encode_input(masked_word, original_word, guessed_letters, embedding_len):\n    vec = [0] * embedding_len\n    missed_vec = [0] * 26\n    revealed_mask = [0] * embedding_len\n    seq_len = len(masked_word)\n    start = embedding_len -
